					Hi Everyone,,
Im 39 years old, male and have had a mechanical aortic valve for over 5 years now and really have never watched what I eat.  I take 10mg of Coumadin a day and all is fine, i drink on the weekends, i play sports, i pretty much do everything.  Lately over the past 6 months i have put on about 20 extra pounds.  I saw a movie called Fat Sick and Nearly Dead and decided to go on a juicing reboot diet.,
I tried contacting my cardio doc quite a few times but got no response, i was going to ask his advice first but since i have a home monitor i figured i would monitor.,
About three days before the juicing fast of 15 days began i started juicing kale, celery, cucumbers etc.. every morning, 24oz, lunch i would also have a juice and dinner was pretty much normal, chicken, vegetables etc..,
Well the day came to start my actual juicing and I did, 2 days later i checked my INR and it sunk to 1.9, my cardio doc says to stay between 2.5 and 3.5, it typically is about 3.5-4.  I tolerate it being a little high alot better than I do being low.  I know both are dangerous but i had some TIA's when it got low when i was out of the hospital and it freaked me out bad.,
I want to be healthy and try to go vegan and stay away from processed foods and red meats but i feel like everything points to eating fresh green veggies (80%) and fruits (20%) or something similar.  I take 10mg of Coumadin daily and really think that is already a very high dose, many say dose based on your diet so if thats the case i would be taking 15-20mg a day which i think is extremely high and not healthy.,
Can anyone lead me in the right direction here, maybe a book, video etc.. i feel like im at the bottom of a well screaming up and no one can hear me.  I want to be healthy but not die trying if that makes sense?,
Thanks,,
Tommy

					I share your feelings about TIA's.  I take 70 to 75 milligrams of warfarin per week and test weekly using my XS. Your activity level is five times what mine is. ,
Possibly your Vit K intake has drastically increased in a short period of time.  What about carbohydrates, you haven't mentioned them.,
Maybe you could source a nutritionist at your local hospital for expert dietary advice.

					You are binging on Kale, which is the highest possible Vit K containing leafy green! Of COURSE your INR is going to drop. Spinach or cabbage or brussels sprouts have 1/2 to 1/3 as much K per serving, but if you've not been eating many greens in your diet, you are going to have to adjust your doseage.,
There are plenty of vegetarians on warfarin.
				",post_message_533204,shnur

					I was just following the juicing / reboot diet to a tee, i had no clue about how much vitamin K was in what, for all i know there is tons of vitamin K in a green apple... im learning though, i would love to hear what vegetarians eat for lunch/dinner on a daily basis and how much of a dosage of Coumadin they are on...,
Thanks,,

					It's easy to lose weight on a drastic diet but almost impossible to keep it off.  You may want to try less drastic changes.  ,
Unless you are pretty savvy (I am not), any major change in diet, if you are on warfarin, should be done with your doctor or nurse practioner's assistance.  At least this is what they told me on discharge this February.  ,
If your cardiologist won't respond, maybe you need a new one, or to see your primary care physician.
				",post_message_533211,shnur

					It looked to me like you planned to DOUBLE your dosage of warfarin because you're getting more Vitamin K in you diet.  This large a change in dosage sounds pretty dangerous -- I'd perhaps increase it 10% or so, and re-test in a few days.  You can always add more warfarin.  DOUBLING your dose can bring you way above range - and put you at risk of hemorrhage.  I know TIAs can be pretty scary (I had one last April), but I sure wouldn't want to deal with major bleeding.,
The suggestion to have a medical professional assist with monitoring and management is a good one.

					My mother's pig valve isn't even 2 years old and is failing! she is already in the serious stage.  how often does this happen?  and why?  She's in her early 80's and the thought of going through surgery again is overwhelming.  She was told it would last much longer than this. Wish she could have minimally invasive surgery, but they (Mayo) tell her regular surgery is best.  has anyone else had a similar situation?
				",post_message_508027,shnur
"
					At your mother's age, I'd have to suspect that there is something wrong with the valve itself.  The younger a person is when they get a tissue valve, the quicker they will need a replacement, however, even 2 years in a very young person is very unusual.  What brand valve does she have?  Which valve is it that needs to be replaced?  What did the Mayo say about the early failure?,
I'm so sorry for this news and I'm sure it is shocking.  They do valve surgery on patients this age more and more frequently with good results.  You have a very good medical team behind her.,

				",post_message_508035,shnur

					I can only imagine how heartsick your mother and your family is over this development. When she had her original replacement, she would have received a card stating the particulars of the valve and a way to communicate with the company. I would start with the company to find an answer. As Kim stated, it probably is a valve failure, and the manufacturer wants to know about it too.,
It is a replacement for the aortic valve? Was the original replacement done at Mayo? I think you still have time to investigate options if the valve is still in the serious stage. If it were me, I would try to get a second opinion for what type of surgery can be done, and I would definitely want to know why this valve failed before I had another one put in.,
Please keep us informed and let us help in any way we can.,

					Thanks Kim and Mary for the posts.  Helps to hear from others.  ,
The cardiologist said there was ""conflicting"" information on her last report and he was going to consult with others and get back to us.  But he did say it's possible they gave her a valve that was too small.  I feel really sick about this now, because I think we threw the paper work that came with the kind of valve she got or what company it was from.  Do you think her medical records would have this info.?  We are thinking of going to Allina in Mlps. for another opinion.  ,
On top of this, my son who is only 15 also has the condition.  We just found out about 1 year ago about him.  (I was tested and don't have it.)  So now I'm thinking how many surgeries will he have to go through in his lifetime?  They tell us he'll need surgery within 10 years or sooner.  life is tough enough as a teenager without this on his mind too.  We aren't telling him about his grandma until we have to.
				",post_message_508051,shnur
"
					Anne,  I'm assuming that since your son has it too, it is her aortic valve?   How is her health otherwise?    If it is her aortic valve, one option to consider is percutaneous replacement of that valve, unless the one she has now is too small which may make that not possible.  The type of valve she received would most certainly be in her surgical notes.  Did she have her original surgery at the Mayo, if so, they typically send out copies of all those notes after each visit/hospital stay.  Others on here are more knowledgeable than me on this, but I didn't realize that a valve being too small could cause it to fail early, I just thought it could cause other issues.,
As for your son, there really is no telling when he will need surgery, and depending on his age at the time, it may be best to consider a mechanical valve for him so he doesn't have to go through numerous surgeries in his lifetime.,

					Anne, ,
I have a bicuspid aortic valve, bav, one son has it, and a grandson (age 2) also has it. Is this the condition you are referring to? If so, your mother actually made it many years without needing replacement, so it's possible that your son will too.,
Is it possible the paperwork you threw away was in regards to something else other than her valve? The valve company sends a card with the information on it and mentions that the card should be carried with the valve recipient at all times. Usually it's not something that one would think was unimportant and pitch. Her cardiologist should also have the valve information. Usually when they run an echocardiogram post-replacement, they want the valve information because the echo's software program needs the information to calculate results.
				",post_message_508070,shnur

					,Yes, they both have BAV stenosis.  it was her aortic valve that they replaced.  Dr. said it's best to wait until she has symptoms again.  she takes BP, chloresteral and thryroid meds.  Drs. gave her a 98% successful surgery rate last time and luckily, surgery went as it should have & no complications.  What is ""percutaneous replacement?""

					I had my surgery just over 2 years ago and must say I would be devastated if I should now learn that, for whatever reason, the valve is up to no good. Tissue valves, both porcine and bovine, are supposed to last much, much longer in us older people, so the 2 years is just so upsetting. You should really try to obtain the particulars of the valve, make, model and serial number. If I were your mother I would definitely alert the manufacturers of the valve. In fact I would strongly insist that my cardiologist and surgeon also involve themselves. Johan

					Anne - So sorry to hear this is happening.  Pig valve failure in 2 years at the age of your mother is not impossible, but extremely rare, as the others posted.  Based on your follow-up comments, I'm wondering if maybe it may be more directly related to the valve size issue, possibly something called ""patient prosthetic mismatch"".  All prosthetic valves reduce the effective opening area of a patient's native valve to a degree, depending on the type of valve used.  In most circumstances, this is not an issue, but for patients with an already small native valve, it can lead to problems.  Let me just say I'm only guessing here, I could be completely off track.  But a common factor for this ""mismatch"" issue are patients who have small aortic roots, seen most frequently in the elderly, particularly women.  The surgery to avoid this potential problem and allow a larger size valve to be implanted involves enlarging the aortic root , which is more complicated and higher risk, not often the first choice procedure.  Again, please forgive me for speculating, but just wanted to mention one possible scenario that could explain valve ""failure"" as it relates to size.,
The percutaneous replacement method mentioned, done through a catheter and not open-heart, was FDA approved only in the last month or so.  It's an amazing breakthrough, but unfortunately is only for patients who meet certain criteria.  Most critically, it is only for those who are deemed otherwise inoperable.,
Best wishes to you and your mother in trying to learn more about this situation, and finding the best possible plan moving forward.

					Thanks again for everyone's well wishes and comments.  I appreciate the support!  The doctor left us that day, last Thurs., telling us he would look at echo himself and consult with collegues.  Now today is late Tues....no call back yet, as he said he would.  I will call him tomorrow.  She says she won't go through another OHS, feels she wouldn't survive it at her age.  I think we will try to go to another Dr. before Christmas, regardless of what this cardiologist says when he calls (if he calls.)

					An update...Card. told her Nov 23 that he and his collegues could not figure out the conflicting info. on her echo and that  he is sending it to a specialist at Mayo, Rochester and he would call us when they know more.  That's been 2 weeks ago!  No news is good news??  Part of me thinks, good, can't be too bad then....but I know I better call and find out what's going on.  In the meantime, she will see another Dr. next week to get a referral to get another opinion.

					Hi Anne,,
I like the premise of no news being good news. To put my mind at ease, I would be putting in a call to the office to confirm this. Glad you are getting another referral. ,
Other than an echo, has she had a TEE or angiogram to confirm the diagnosis? I would want another type of test to confirm the echo (which isn't always reliable). ,
All the best,
				",post_message_509218,shnur

					Ditto to ottagal.  I'd get that call placed as soon as possible; this can be a difficult time of year to get things done.  And more expert opinions probably can't hurt.

					Ann, I am truly sorry your mother has to go through this!    My first thought would be that there was something wrong with the valve itself, or maybe a mis-match??   Tissue valves ordinarily last much long, especially in the elderly.
				",post_message_509327,shnur

					Sorry to hear your mother's predicament. I hope the consult with another doctor will help clarify the situation.,
Just to echo what others have said, me stepson had an echo that came back with rather frightening results about 3 years ago. Then he had a catheter procedure done and the results came back in the ""normal"" range. Getting a more specific and predictable test done is definitely an option. I'm surprised that the doctors haven't discussed that with you and her.

					Did she have a mosaic valve by any chance? Lots of early failures (incluing 4 years for me) from what people have said on this site. My surgeon said it was something to do with what it was coated in. However, there are many people with this valve who have no problems.,
Other issues for early failure are kidney problems and potentially high blood pressure. ,
I didn't think they could do catheter ops with porcine valves but I could be wrong. It could be done minimal invasive if there isn't too much scar tissue.,
If she does have the op again it may be worth getting a mechanical valve. Although rare at an older age it would be a risk to get another tissue valve if it were to fail again (unless there is an obvious cause),
Just go let you know that reops are not generally more risky than first ops although I know your mums age is also a risk factor for a 2nd reop. This is definitely something that should be sorted out ASAP. The fitter a person is that goes into surgery the better the outcome, no matter what age. ,
Good luck.

					It sounds like they're concerned that there's a patient-prosthesis mismatch, which is when they put in the wrong size valve (usually too small, although too large can cause just as much trouble).  Other than that, it would have to be an actual failure of the valve structure.  She didn't calcify it in two years.  Too small, it causes instant stenosis.  Too large, the leaflets of the valve rub and get caught and damaged by the surrounding structure. ,
The thing I'm wondering about is why they haven't redone the echocardiogram with a different tech and different machine (unless they have and I missed it).  Conflicting results and no symptoms should be waving red flags.,
Percutaneous replacement is so much less demanding than the full surgery.  If I were her, I would want to go with that.  As far as I'm aware, all of the percutaneously-replaced valves are xenografts (biological valves).  In this situation (depending on what that turns out to be), the only good thing about the current valve being biological is that it allows replacement with a percutaneous valve.  If it were a mechanical valve, it would require the reoperation.,
Best wishes,

					I have a mosaic porcine heart valve. My surgery will be 4 years old in January. After 6 mts my valve was failing. I saw another surgeon in Houston and he agreed that it was failing but thought I would get another 3 years out of it and would be replaced with a mechanical valve. I had an echo done two weeks ago and there is no further change in the valve. It's the same today as it was six months after I had surgery. No one could tell me why, just one of those things however when it's you it's not just one of those things. I am 70 now and certainly am not looking forward to another surgery but maybe I'll continue to beat the odds and I do  hope your Mother does as well. As everyone else said follow up, get another opinion.

					I'm sorry to hear about your mom, Hopefully they can help her without needing surgery. FWIW I wouldn't get my hopes too high she would be a candidate for Percutaneous replacement (TAVI) IF the problem is her current valve is too small. Since they place the valve inside the current valve the TAVI valve is slightly smaller than the valve it is placed in side, so it sounds like she would need a larger valve then they put in her last time. Also they dont make TAVI valves that fit inside the small Aortic valves yet.. ,
I definately would ask about it, incase it is an option or there is another reason it needs replaced beside they used too small a valve the first surgery.

					Wow...I had no idea so many of you responded since the last time I updated this post!  THANK YOU!  It's very comforting....,
I think the day after my last post, she got the call.  I also called the cardio. and had him repeat to me.  It was a patient mis-match that caused this.  Her ""gradient"" level went form 16 to 28 to 40 to 44 (every 6 months) since the surgery 2 years ago...he says the ""good news"" is that the 40 to 44 isn't too much change over the last 6 months and hopefully it will continue to not increase much.  We went to another clinic last week, that Dr. (family physician) look at the last echo results and report and was equally surprised by it.  He apologized to her for this on ""behalf of all physicians"" for this mistake.  She will have another echo at this new clinic in Jan and then see a new cardio. for another opinion.  The new family physician agreed to postpone another surgery for as long as possible, but she refuses to have another OH surgery anyway.  no one has suggested any other type of test as of yet. ,
On another note...my 16 yr. old had a gradient of 30 a year ago...he will see cardio. in Jan. also....just alot to deal with at this time of year.

My son had his annual checkup and was told his is at gradiant of 40.  I don't understand these gradiant numbers....we were told 44 is severe, yet my son went from a 30 to 40 in one year & won't need surgery for hopefully 10 years yet (we were told).  How bad does your number need to be to have surgery?  or do they just go by if you have symptoms?

					I'm fairly certain your dentist is propagating myth with imaginary diagnosis's for phenomena that he can't explain. Here is all of the adverse reactions and I don't see dry mouth anywhere.,
ADVERSE REACTIONS,
Potential adverse reactions to COUMADIN may include:,
• Fatal or nonfatal hemorrhage from any tissue or organ. This is a consequence of the anticoagulant effect. The,
signs, symptoms, and severity will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding.,
Hemorrhagic complications may present as paralysis; paresthesia; headache, chest, abdomen, joint, muscle or,
other pain; dizziness; shortness of breath, difficult breathing or swallowing; unexplained swelling; weakness;,
hypotension; or unexplained shock. Therefore, the possibility of hemorrhage should be considered in evaluating,
the condition of any anticoagulated patient with complaints which do not indicate an obvious diagnosis. Bleeding,
during anticoagulant therapy does not always correlate with PT/INR. (See OVERDOSAGE: Treatment.),
• Bleeding which occurs when the PT/INR is within the therapeutic range warrants diagnostic investigation since,
it may unmask a previously unsuspected lesion, e.g., tumor, ulcer, etc.,
• Necrosis of skin and other tissues. (See WARNINGS.),
• Adverse reactions reported infrequently include: hypersensitivity/allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions,,
systemic cholesterol microembolization, purple toes syndrome, hepatitis, cholestatic hepatic injury, jaundice,,
elevated liver enzymes, hypotension, vasculitis, edema, anemia, pallor, fever, rash, dermatitis, including bullous,
eruptions, urticaria, angina syndrome, chest pain, abdominal pain including cramping, flatulence/bloating, fatigue,,
lethargy, malaise, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain, headache, dizziness, loss of consciousness, syncope,,
coma, taste perversion, pruritus, alopecia, cold intolerance, and paresthesia including feeling cold and chills.,
Rare events of tracheal or tracheobronchial calcification have been reported in association with long-term warfarin,
therapy. The clinical significance of this event is unknown.,
Priapism has been associated with anticoagulant administration; however, a causal relationship has not been established.

					Coumadin/Warfarin does , cause dry mouth, however many, many medications do.  Dry mouth is the death of teeth.  Saliva is the 1st line of defense against cavities.  We have so many elderly in our office with rampant cavities because their medications cause dry mouth, and to combat that, they suck on hard candy, mints or cough drops.,
I would suggest that you look at your entire list of medications, read the informational sheets that come with them from the pharmacy, so you know which meds might be causing this.  Even so, you'll probably not be able to stop the medications.  ,
Try to find sugarless gum and candies that contain Xylitol.  Xylitol is a sugar alcohol made from beech bark, birch bark, corn cobs and other food items.  It must be counted in a diabetics diet.  If you eat too much it can cause intestinal upset like mannitol and sorbitol.  But your body does adjust.  The bacteria that cause cavities eat the xylitol and die instead of creating acid that eats at the teeth. It is a great defense.,
Hope this helps.

					There are a variety of medications that cause dry mouth, and some, like antihistamines, are available over-the-counter. There are also some medical conditions outside of salivary gland problems(like stones, etc) that cause it, like Sjogren's Syndrome, which is an autoimmune phenomenon. It is also frequently associated with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn's disease, diabetes, and even some thyroid problems. Sometimes it is the first symptom of one of these problems, so if you are having a lot of joint pain, etc, ask your doc to test you. If you are taking diuretics, or have to limit your fluid intake, it can be extremely hard to treat. There are a couple of medications-Salagen and Evozac-that can help stimulate saliva production. Sugar-free sour candies can stimulate saliva production as well.,

					,WARFARIN SODIUM (in Coumadin Tablets) may interact with DOXYCYCLINE (in Periostat Tablets),
Blood clotting normally occurs in response to a cut or other types of injuries to protect the body from excessive bleeding. Many substances are involved in the clotting process including various chemicals that are produced in the body like vitamin K. Vitamin K is made by bacteria that are normally present in the intestinal tract and may also be supplied in the diet by eating green leafy vegetables, liver, and egg yolks. Doxycycline may kill the bacteria responsible for producing vitamin K. Warfarin is generally used to prevent your blood from ""coagulating"" or forming blood clots. When doxycycline and warfarin are used at the same time, your blood may be much less likely to clot and this may increase the risk of excessive bleeding. If these drugs are used together, your doctor may want to monitor you closely for signs of bleeding (bruising, nose bleeds, ect). Blood tests can be used to make sure that you are getting the right amount of warfarin. If you are experiencing problems, it may be necessary to adjust the dose of warfarin. Ask your healthcare provider about these drugs and this potential interaction as soon as possible.,
This interaction is poorly documented and is considered major in severity.,

Like everything else, it will have to be adjusted for.
